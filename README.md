# denseNet-pneumonia
Chest X-ray pneumonia classification using DenseNet121 and deep learning


### Why DenseNet121?

DenseNet introduces dense connectivity —> each layer receives inputs from all previous layers.
Encourages feature reuse
Reduces number of parameters compared to ResNet
Captures fine-grained medical features effectively
Proven strong performance on image classification tasks
